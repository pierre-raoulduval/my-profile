     Hello, my name is Pierre RAOUL-DUVAL, and I will introduce myself in a few words. I like playing rugby, watching it, I'm quite good at video games and I love maths.

   <h2>😈The hommies😈</h2>
   <p>
  My best friends are Guéric and Hani, but they were my high school friends, so I don't see them a lot anymore, however when I go back to Rouen, my hometown, we still have the same chemistry. I also have a girlfriend who is with me in Cergy.

   <h2>🍻My school career🍻</h2>
   <p>
  I have been studying at ESSEC Business School in Cergy, France since September 2023. There, I tasted the real student life for the first time : the one where you can party anytime you want, not listen in class if you want to, but you get what you give, so when I had a 0 in accountancy, I decided I maybe should start working, so I did and I ended up 492 out of 667. It isn't the best score, but I'm confident I will improve during my second semester. Before that, I did both my high and secondary school in Rouen, in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lasallerouen/" target="_blank" class="btn-blue">👨‍💼Saint Jean-Baptiste De la Salle👨‍💼</a>

      <h2>😎When I have some free time I:😎</h2>
   <p>
  I have many hobbies that have sometimes become passions for me. For example, a few years ago, I started playing video games on my parent's tablet, and now I have become so good at it that I am in an E-team, and I don't only play for fun, but also because it's serious and professional. I used to have a passion for rugby, but I had to stop with the lockdown, soo now I only watch it instead of playing it, it's still fun but some part of me misses the thrill.
